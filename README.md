## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found requirements.txt. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Due to rise in the bicycle-sharing systems in major cities in the US and the world, there is a need to understand the bike share usage pattern. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
Hence, data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, is used to write a python script that aims to uncover bike share usage patterns in three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## File Descriptions
There is 1 python available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. There are 4 csv files here; the training dataset, test dataset, a submission ssample file and a bike share prediction file.
