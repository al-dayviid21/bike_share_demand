## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found in requirements.txt. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Due to rise in the bicycle-sharing systems in major cities in the US and the world, a new challenge has sprung up. The challenge is the need to accurately predict the demand for these bikes at a given day and hour. A need to correctly allocate resources cannot be overstated. Thus, this project aims to create a machine learning model that can help the user accurately provide resources (bikes) according to certain input information. For this project, information such as data, time, weather/climate conditions, working or non-working days are used to predict the demand for bikes. 

## File Descriptions
There is 1 python available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. There are 4 csv files here; the training dataset, test dataset, a submission ssample file and a bike share prediction file.
